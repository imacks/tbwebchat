tbwebchat
=========
Chrome browser extension to re-enable webchat in taobao.com.

You still **must be signed in** to taobao.com.

Taobao.com has a chat program called Aliwangwang that allows you to live chat with the seller. There is an option in user settings to 
choose between launching the installed program or use the web version, but it doesn't work on non-mobile OSes anymore (i.e. you must 
install Aliwangwang on your PC in order to chat with seller). This extension when active brings back the web version.
